*Website for Weebook*

**TO-DO LIST**

- On the homepage, the text should be bigger and links should be of a lighter color;
- The footer should be included on every single page to have a better idea of the final look (should do the same with the header);
- On the "products" page, the responsive design shouldn't transform the squares into rectangles;
